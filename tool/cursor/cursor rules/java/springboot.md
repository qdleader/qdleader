Spring Boot Best Practices and Coding Standards

This document outlines best practices and coding standards for developing applications with Spring Boot. Following these guidelines will help ensure that your applications are robust, maintainable, performant, and secure.

1. Code Organization and Structure

1.1 Directory Structure

Adopt a layered architecture to separate concerns and improve maintainability. A recommended directory structure is:


src/
 ├── main/
 │   ├── java/
 │   │   └── com/example/app/
 │   │       ├── Application.java (Main entry point)
 │   │       ├── config/          (Configuration classes)
 │   │       ├── controller/      (REST controllers)
 │   │       ├── service/         (Business logic services)
 │   │       ├── repository/      (Data access repositories)
 │   │       ├── model/           (Data transfer objects (DTOs), entities)
 │   │       ├── exception/       (Custom exceptions)
 │   │       ├── util/            (Utility classes)
 │   │       └── security/        (Security-related classes)
 │   └── resources/
 │       ├── application.properties/application.yml (Application configuration)
 │       ├── static/            (Static resources like HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
 │       └── templates/         (View templates, e.g., Thymeleaf)
 └── test/
     ├── java/
     │   └── com/example/app/
     │       ├── controller/      (Controller tests)
     │       ├── service/         (Service tests)
     │       └── repository/      (Repository tests)
     └── resources/
         ├── application.properties/application.yml (Test-specific configuration)


- Root Package: Choose a meaningful root package name (e.g., com.yourcompany.appname).
- Modularization: For larger applications, consider breaking down the application into modules (e.g., using Maven or Gradle modules) based on business domains or features.

1.2 File Naming Conventions

- Classes: Use PascalCase (e.g., UserController, ProductService).
- Interfaces: Use PascalCase, often prefixed with I (e.g., ProductRepository, IOrderService). Consider omitting the I prefix if it doesn't add value.
- Methods: Use camelCase (e.g., getUserById, calculateTotal).
- Variables: Use camelCase (e.g., userName, productPrice).
- Constants: Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., MAX_RETRIES, DEFAULT_TIMEOUT).
- Configuration Files: Use lowercase with hyphens (e.g., application.properties, bootstrap.yml).

1.3 Module Organization

For larger projects, break down the application into modules. Each module should represent a distinct business domain or feature.

- Maven/Gradle Modules: Use Maven or Gradle to manage module dependencies and build processes.
- Clear Boundaries: Define clear interfaces between modules to promote loose coupling.
- Independent Deployments: Design modules to be independently deployable, if possible.

1.4 Component Architecture

- Controllers: Handle incoming requests and delegate to services. Keep controllers thin.
- Services: Implement business logic. Services should be transactional.
- Repositories: Provide data access abstraction. Use Spring Data JPA or other data access technologies.
- Models: Represent data structures. Use DTOs for transferring data between layers and entities for persistence.

1.5 Code Splitting Strategies

- Feature-Based Splitting: Group code related to a specific feature into its own package or module.
- Layer-Based Splitting: Separate code based on layers (e.g., presentation, business logic, data access).
- Horizontal vs. Vertical Slicing: Consider horizontal slicing (grouping similar functionalities across features) or vertical slicing (grouping all functionalities for a specific feature) based on project needs.

2. Common Patterns and Anti-Patterns

2.1 Design Patterns Specific to Spring Boot

- Dependency Injection (DI): Use constructor injection for required dependencies and setter injection for optional dependencies.
- Inversion of Control (IoC): Let the Spring container manage the lifecycle and dependencies of your beans.
- Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP): Use AOP for cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, and transaction management.
- Repository Pattern: Use Spring Data repositories for simplified data access.
- Service Layer Pattern: Decouple controllers from business logic by introducing a service layer.
- Template Method Pattern: Use JdbcTemplate or RestTemplate for consistent data access or external API calls.
- Factory Pattern: Use @Configuration classes and @Bean methods to define and configure beans.

2.2 Recommended Approaches for Common Tasks

- Configuration: Use application.properties or application.yml for externalized configuration. Use @ConfigurationProperties to bind configuration properties to a class.
- Logging: Use SLF4J for logging abstraction and a suitable logging implementation (e.g., Logback or Log4j2).
- Exception Handling: Use @ControllerAdvice to handle exceptions globally. Create custom exception classes for specific error scenarios.
- Validation: Use JSR-303 Bean Validation for validating request parameters and request bodies. Use @Validated annotation with appropriate groups.
- Data Transfer: Use DTOs to transfer data between layers to avoid exposing internal data structures.
- Asynchronous Operations: Use @Async annotation and TaskExecutor to perform asynchronous operations.
- Caching: Use Spring's caching abstraction with implementations like Ehcache, Caffeine, or Redis.
- Scheduling: Use @Scheduled annotation to schedule tasks.
- Transaction Management: Use @Transactional annotation for managing transactions.

2.3 Anti-Patterns and Code Smells to Avoid

- God Class: A class that does too much. Break it down into smaller, more focused classes.
- Long Method: A method that is too long and complex. Extract smaller methods.
- Feature Envy: A method that accesses data from another object more than its own. Move the method to the other object.
- Data Clumps: Groups of data that frequently appear together. Create a new class to encapsulate the data clump.
- Primitive Obsession: Using primitive data types instead of creating meaningful domain objects.
- Shotgun Surgery: Making small changes in many different places. Refactor the code to centralize the changes.
- Spaghetti Code: Code that is difficult to understand and maintain due to its tangled structure.
- Copy-Paste Programming: Duplicating code instead of reusing existing code. Create reusable components or methods.
- Field Injection: Use constructor injection instead for required dependencies.
- Tight Coupling: Classes that are highly dependent on each other. Decouple the classes using interfaces or abstract classes.
- Ignoring Exceptions: Catching exceptions but not handling them properly. Log the exception and take appropriate action.
- Over-Engineering: Making the code too complex for the problem it solves. Keep it simple and only add complexity when needed.

2.4 State Management Best Practices

- Stateless Services: Design services to be stateless whenever possible. This improves scalability and testability.
- Session Management: Use Spring Session to manage user sessions in a distributed environment. Store session data in a persistent store like Redis or a database.
- Caching: Use caching to store frequently accessed data. Choose a suitable caching strategy (e.g., LRU, FIFO).
- Database: Use a relational database or a NoSQL database to persist data.
- Distributed Transactions: Use distributed transaction management techniques like two-phase commit (2PC) or Saga pattern for transactions spanning multiple services.

2.5 Error Handling Patterns

- Global Exception Handling: Use @ControllerAdvice and @ExceptionHandler to handle exceptions globally.
- Custom Exceptions: Create custom exception classes for specific error scenarios.
- Logging: Log exceptions with sufficient context information (e.g., request parameters, user ID).
- Error Responses: Return meaningful error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.
- Retry Mechanism: Implement a retry mechanism for transient errors.
- Circuit Breaker: Use a circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures.
- Dead Letter Queue: Use a dead letter queue to handle messages that cannot be processed.

3. Performance Considerations
